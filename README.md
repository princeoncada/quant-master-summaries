# Quant Master Summaries

This repository contains study notes and summaries for each of my many quant projects.  
Each summary is designed to be beginner-friendly, detailed, and code-backed, so I (or anyone learning quant finance) can review the concepts anytime.

## Structure
- `Summaries/` → A collection of markdown files, one per project
- Each file contains:
  - Concept explanations
  - Code snippets
  - Math intuition
  - Key takeaways

## Completed Summaries
- ✅ [Project 1: Market Data Loader & Returns Analysis](Summaries/market_data_returns.md)
- ✅ [Project 2: Randomness in FX vs Coin Flips](Summaries/randomness_fx_coin.md)
